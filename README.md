👋 Hi there!

🎓 I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Geography at the University at Buffalo, under the guidance of [Prof. Andrew Crooks](https://www.gisagents.org/p/about-gis-and-agent-based-modeling.html). My academic journey revolves around agent-based modeling, geographic information science, machine learning, and urban simulation. I hold an MSc and BSc in Physics from the National University of Singapore.

🔍 Before diving into the world of research, I honed my skills in the industry:

- 📊 Data Scientist at Hewlett Packard Enterprise's APAC Innovation Center in Singapore.
- 🔧 R&D Engineer at TUMCREATE and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) Centre.
- 💻 Software Engineer at Cognizant.
